Handling large amounts of data can be overwhelming and slow when processed
manually, e.g. by human labor. Computers have unlocked the possibility to quickly
and more efficiently process and manage massive amounts of data. As it might be
expected, the uses for an effective classifier method has found many areas. E.g.,
given many different types of articles, it might be desirable to sort them by genre (business, sports, tabloid articles, and so forth). Another use is finding correlations that may not be obvious. A large and seemingly unrelated set of data, can be divided based on similarity. This process is known as "clustering". Tuning the restrictions on similarity between data may result in different groupings, allowing the researcher to manipulate the results and retrieve the amount of clusters desired. This provides researchers with a useful method to find undetected groupings. These two uses showcase different properties of the general concepts within machine learning (Scikit-learn, 2014).
