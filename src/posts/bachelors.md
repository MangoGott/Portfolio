**A thesis allowing us to delve deeper into the development of current machine learning technologies. Studying and implementing both supervised and semi supervised machine learning methods.**

Handling large amounts of data can be overwhelming and slow when processed manually, e.g. by human labor. Computers have unlocked the possibility to quickly and more efficiently process and manage massive amounts of data. As it might be expected, the uses for an effective classifier method has found many areas. E.g., given many different types of articles, it might be desirable to sort them by genre (business, sports, tabloid articles, and so forth). Another use is finding correlations that may not be obvious. A large and seemingly unrelated set of data, can be divided based on similarity. This process is known as "clustering". Tuning the restrictions on similarity between data may result in different groupings, allowing the researcher to manipulate the results and retrieve the amount of clusters desired. This provides researchers with a useful method to find undetected groupings. These two uses showcase different properties of the general concepts within machine learning (Scikit-learn, 2014). 

To successfully perform a overall analysis a simple but productive environment containing two classes is established for the evaluation of the chosen learning methods. A suitable choice of environment is email boxes polluted with spam; which leads to the application of binary classifiers in a spam filter. To succeed with this objective, greater understanding of the concepts of spam needs to be acquired. Once adequate research has been performed, a series of experiments is ready to be conducted in order to investigate the performance of each method in increasing population size. The aim is not to discover which method is the best, but to gain understanding of the conditions leading to potentially different results between the chosen methods. In more detail, this report covers how a study of classifier behaviour in relation to the chosen input data is conducted, followed by a discussion concerning the strengths and weaknesses of each tested classifier.
