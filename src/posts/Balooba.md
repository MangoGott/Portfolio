**A web application for Film Loversâ€‹. A web app where users could create and save lists of movies. All data was fetched from The Movie Database (TMDb) API as JSON objects. This data together with the userdata was stored using MongoDB.**

Users where stored and had to log in using their username and password. When logged in, they could browse different films, read about them, then finally create and add them to different lists. I was responsible for the search page where search terms were queried and then displayed. Together with the Dinner Planner project, I learnt how to handle API-keys, sending HTTP GET request, and much more!
