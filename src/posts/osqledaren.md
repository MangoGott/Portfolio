**As editor-in-chief for two years, I overlooked the production of “Osqledaren”. A magazine published four times a year, 12 000 copies each edition, mainly targeted at students.**

My editorial staff consisted of 32 driven students who together with me produced articles, films, podcasts and much more. I also worked a lot with digitizing the magazine by further developing our website osqledaren.se and by expanding our reach on social media.

Starting out at Osqledaren, I was responsible for the development of a new branch aimed at producing media content for the internet. This included different film projects (on-the-street interviews as well as more serious sit-downs with more important guests), but more importantly different podcast productions. Through the years, I’ve been at both ends of the production pipeline. As the interviewer, editor, and in later years, as the producer over-looking and organizing other people’s projects.

In 2017, I worked my way up to become the editor-in-chief and publisher of the magazine. A full-time job I carried out for two years. With an editorial staff of around 30 people. During these years I was not only organizing brainstorming sessions with the whole staff but also producing articles of my own (including editorials). What I loved the most was guiding my writers (including English writers), illustrators, and photographers to find the right angle to their stories. This includes contacting and booking interviews with leads, applying for press accreditation, and proof-reading every article. 

Daily tasks included management of a voluntarily committed editorial staff (~30 students), a fair share of my own journalistic production, layout, budget & economic responsibility, and more.

The last story I wrote for the magazine took me on a two-day trip following a student-orchestra to a music festival. I conducted hours of interviews, resulting in even more hours spent transcribing. One thing I truly enjoyed was sifting through all the recorded content, slowly piecing it together and figuring out what best fit the story I was writing.
